# Logo Creator

## User Story
AS a freelance web developer
<br>
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
<br>
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer

## Description
This challenge was to create a generic logo design and have it save as a .svg file. Criteria included, but is not limited to, choosing a basic shape and its color. Another main point to this assignment was make use of Nodejs and testing. 

Creating tests makes the code more maintainable and helps when multiple people are working together on the same project. This can help prevent unexpected changes to the project as a whole.
